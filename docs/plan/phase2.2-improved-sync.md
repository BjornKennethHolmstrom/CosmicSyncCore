# Improved Data Synchronization

## Objectives
- [ ] Implement advanced conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Develop efficient delta synchronization
- [ ] Create a robust offline-first sync mechanism
- [ ] Implement data integrity checks during synchronization
- [ ] Develop prioritization mechanisms for sync operations
- [ ] Create a sync conflict visualization tool for developers

## Key Components
1. Conflict Resolution
   - [ ] Implement Operational Transformation (OT) for text-based data
   - [ ] Develop Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) for structured data

2. Delta Synchronization
   - [ ] Implement efficient change detection
   - [ ] Develop delta compression for sync operations

3. Offline-First Sync
   - [ ] Create local-first data operations
   - [ ] Implement queue for offline changes
   - [ ] Develop intelligent sync on reconnection

## Implementation Details
- Use a combination of OT and CRDTs based on data types
- Implement a vector clock system for tracking changes
- Develop a custom delta compression algorithm

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Integration tests for complex sync scenarios
- [ ] Stress tests for large-scale sync operations

## Documentation
- [ ] Document conflict resolution strategies
- [ ] Create developer guide for implementing offline-first features

## Next Steps
- Implement more advanced CRDTs for complex data structures
- Develop machine learning-based conflict resolution for ambiguous cases
