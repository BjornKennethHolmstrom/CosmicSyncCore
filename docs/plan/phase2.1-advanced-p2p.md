# Advanced P2P Features

## Objectives
- [ ] Enhance peer discovery and connection mechanisms
- [ ] Implement advanced NAT traversal techniques
- [ ] Develop more sophisticated message routing
- [ ] Implement network resilience strategies (e.g., automatic reconnection, fallback mechanisms)
- [ ] Develop bandwidth optimization techniques
- [ ] Implement basic network analytics and monitoring

## Key Components
1. Enhanced Peer Discovery
   - [ ] Implement distributed peer discovery
   - [ ] Develop peer reputation system
