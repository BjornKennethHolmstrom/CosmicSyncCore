# Security Audit Framework

## Objectives
- [ ] Develop comprehensive security audit processes
- [ ] Implement automated security scanning tools
- [ ] Create a vulnerability management system
- [ ] Establish a security scoring mechanism

## Key Components
1. Audit Processes
   - [ ] Develop internal security audit checklists
   - [ ] Establish procedures for regular security reviews

2. Automated Scanning
   - [ ] Implement static code analysis tools
   - [ ] Set up dynamic application security testing (DAST)

3. Vulnerability Management
   - [ ] Create a vulnerability tracking system
   - [ ] Implement a responsible disclosure program

4. Security Scoring
   - [ ] Develop a security maturity model
   - [ ] Implement a quantitative security scoring system

## Implementation Details
- Integrate security scanning into the CI/CD pipeline
- Use industry-standard vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE)
- Implement OWASP ZAP for dynamic security testing
- Develop custom security metrics based on system architecture

## Testing
- [ ] Simulated security audit runs
- [ ] Verification of vulnerability remediation processes
- [ ] Testing of security score calculations
- [ ] Validation of automated scanning accuracy

## Documentation
- [ ] Security audit guidebook
- [ ] Vulnerability response procedures
- [ ] Regular security status reporting templates

## Next Steps
- Engage with external security auditors for independent assessments
- Develop an AI-assisted security analysis system
