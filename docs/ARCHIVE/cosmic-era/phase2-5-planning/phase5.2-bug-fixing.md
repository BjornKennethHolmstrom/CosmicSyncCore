# Bug Fixing and Stability Enhancements

## Objectives
- [ ] Resolve all critical and high-priority bugs
- [ ] Enhance system stability across all components
- [ ] Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Optimize resource management and memory usage

## Key Components
1. Bug Resolution
   - [ ] Prioritize and address all reported bugs
   - [ ] Conduct root cause analysis for recurring issues
   - [ ] Implement fixes with thorough regression testing

2. Stability Enhancements
   - [ ] Improve error handling and logging across the system
   - [ ] Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
   - [ ] Enhance retry mechanisms for transient errors

3. Resource Optimization
   - [ ] Conduct memory profiling and fix any leaks
   - [ ] Optimize CPU and network resource usage
   - [ ] Improve database query performance

4. Crash Analysis and Prevention
   - [ ] Implement crash reporting and analysis tools
   - [ ] Conduct post-mortem analysis on any system crashes
   - [ ] Develop preventive measures for common crash scenarios

## Implementation Details
- Use error tracking tools like Sentry for centralized error logging and analysis
- Implement chaos engineering principles to identify potential failure points
- Utilize APM (Application Performance Management) tools for resource usage insights
- Develop custom crash analysis tools integrated with the system's architecture

## Documentation
- [ ] Maintain a detailed bug tracker with resolution status
- [ ] Document common issues and their solutions for user reference
- [ ] Create internal playbooks for handling critical system failures
- [ ] Update system architecture documents to reflect stability enhancements

## Next Steps
- Establish a continuous improvement process for ongoing stability enhancements
- Plan for regular system health checks and preemptive maintenance
