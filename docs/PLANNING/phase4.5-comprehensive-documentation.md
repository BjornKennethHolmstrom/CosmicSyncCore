- [ ] Create comprehensive developer documentation
- [ ] Implement interactive learning resources
- [ ] Establish a knowledge base and community forum

## Key Components
1. User Documentation
   - [ ] Create user manuals for all system features
   - [ ] Develop quick start guides for new users
   - [ ] Implement context-sensitive help within the application

2. Developer Documentation
   - [ ] Create detailed API reference documentation

   - [ ] Implement code samples and tutorials for common scenarios

3. Interactive Learning Resources
   - [ ] Develop interactive tutorials and walkthroughs
   - [ ] Create video tutorials for visual learners
   - [ ] Implement a code playground for hands-on learning

4. Knowledge Base and Community Forum
   - [ ] Establish a searchable knowledge base of FAQs and articles
   - [ ] Implement a community-driven forum for user discussions
   - [ ] Create a system for users to contribute to documentation

## Implementation Details
- Use a documentation-as-code approach with tools like Sphinx or MkDocs
- Implement OpenAPI (Swagger) for auto-generated API documentation
- Develop custom interactive components for in-app tutorials
- Use a modern forum software like Discourse for the community platform

## Testing
- [ ] Usability testing of documentation navigation and search
- [ ] Accuracy verification of all documented features and APIs
- [ ] User acceptance testing of interactive learning resources
- [ ] Load testing of the knowledge base and community forum

## Documentation (Meta)
- [ ] Style guide for maintaining consistent documentation
- [ ] Contribution guidelines for community-generated content
- [ ] Versioning strategy for documentation aligned with software releases

## Next Steps
- Explore AI-powered documentation assistants for users and developers
- Investigate augmented reality (AR) for advanced interactive tutorials
