# Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and API

## Goals and Objectives
- [x] Establish the foundational architecture for CivicBase
- [x] Implement basic P2P networking capabilities
- [x] Develop essential data management features
- [x] Implement core security measures
- [x] Create a stable and well-documented API
- [x] Establish error handling and logging framework
- [x] Develop basic monitoring and health check capabilities

## Components to be Developed
1. P2P Networking Layer
2. Data Management System
3. Security Framework
4. Core API

## Key Features and Functionalities
- Basic node discovery and connection
- Fundamental data storage and retrieval
- Essential encryption and authentication
- RESTful API for basic CRUD operations
- Core security features including encryption and access control

## Dependencies and Prerequisites
- Node.js environment
- Selected P2P library (e.g., libp2p)
- Database system (e.g., SQLite for local storage)
- API framework (e.g., Express.js)
- Cryptography library (e.g., Node.js crypto module)

## Estimated Timeline
- 10-12 weeks

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Functional P2P network with basic node communication
- [x] Ability to store and retrieve data across the network
- [x] Implementation of basic security features (encryption, authentication, access control)
- [x] Documented API with essential endpoints for data operations
- [ ] Successful completion of integration tests for all core components
- [x] Basic security audit passed
