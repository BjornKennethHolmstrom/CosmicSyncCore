# CivicBase Vision
## Resilient Digital Infrastructure for Swedish Municipalities

> *"November 2024's cable cuts in the Baltic Sea exposed a critical vulnerability: Swedish society is completely dependent on centralized internet infrastructure and American cloud services. When cables are severed, municipal services stop. CivicBase is the offline-first platform that changes this."*

## The Problem: Digital Sovereignty at Risk

Sweden's digital infrastructure has three critical dependencies:

### 1. **Internet Backbone Vulnerability**
- Single points of failure (undersea cables, ISP backbones)
- November 2024: C-Lion1 and BCS East-West cable cuts demonstrated risk
- Current municipal systems: 100% cloud-dependent, 0% offline capability
- Recovery time: Unknown, depends on American/European infrastructure

### 2. **Cloud Service Lock-In**
- 95%+ of Swedish municipal IT runs on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
- All data stored outside Sweden's borders
- Service continuity requires uninterrupted internet access
- Geopolitical de-platforming risk (sanctions, political pressure)

### 3. **Economic Centralization**
- Payment systems (Swish/BankID) require central servers + internet
- 95% cashless society = total vulnerability during disruptions
- Local communities cannot maintain economic activity during crises
- Care economy (elder care, childcare, community services) becomes impossible

**This isn't just inconvenient—it's a totalförsvar failure.**

## Our Solution: CivicBase Platform

**CivicBase is offline-first, P2P infrastructure that enables Swedish municipalities to maintain critical services during infrastructure disruptions.**

We're building a platform where:

### 🔐 Data Stays in Sweden
- P2P architecture eliminates dependency on foreign cloud providers
- All data stored locally on Swedish devices
- End-to-end encryption by default
- GDPR-compliant by design (data minimization, user control)

### 🌐 Services Continue Offline
- Mesh networking enables local coordination without internet
- Offline transactions sync automatically when connectivity returns
- 72+ hour resilience target for critical municipal functions
- Gradual degradation, not total failure

### 💚 Communities Build Social Capital
- Hearts currency makes invisible care economy visible
- Valorizes unpaid care work (MSB's "försvarsvilja" operationalized)
- Local resilience networks active in peacetime, ready for crisis
- Trust networks resist destabilization (Ukraine lesson)

## What Makes This Different

### We're Building for Crisis, Not Convenience
Most digital platforms optimize for user growth and engagement. CivicBase optimizes for **crisis resilience and democratic continuity**.

### Offline-First, Not Offline-Capable
Blockchain requires global consensus. Cloud apps require central servers. CivicBase uses **libp2p P2P architecture** that works *better* locally:
- Direct device-to-device communication
- No central servers to fail or attack
- Mesh networking when infrastructure fails
- Eventual consistency when connectivity returns

### Dual-Use Design
- **Peacetime:** Municipal innovation (TAK-405 wellness, DPOP organizing, DiDiS identity)
- **Crisis:** Critical redundancy (economic continuity, resource coordination, democratic operations)

This isn't a "backup system." It's **infrastructure that makes everyday services more resilient by default.**

## The Applications We Enable

CivicBase isn't one app—it's a **platform for crisis-ready municipal services**:

### 💚 TAK-405 "Regionens Nervsystem"
Transit wellness system using Hearts currency to reduce psychological stress in Stockholm's public transport. Proof-of-concept for offline economic transactions.

### 🗳️ DPOP (Democratic Party Operations Platform)
Political organizing that continues during cable cuts. Meetings, decisions, coordination—all offline-capable with sync when connectivity returns.

### 🆔 DiDiS (Distributed Digital Identity System)
Privacy-preserving identity verification without central databases. Agent-centric architecture means no single point of compromise.

### 🏥 Future: Municipal Services
- Healthcare records (offline-capable, privacy-preserving)
- Elder care coordination (works in rural areas with poor connectivity)
- Emergency response (mesh networking for neighborhood coordination)
- Climate adaptation (local resilience tracking)

## Our Technical Approach

### Peer-to-Peer Foundation (libp2p)
- Battle-tested technology (powers IPFS, Filecoin globally)
- No central servers = no single point of failure
- NAT traversal for global connectivity
- Efficient mesh networking when internet fails

### Agent-Centric Data Model
- Each user controls their own data
- Cryptographic identity (no central database to compromise)
- Granular sharing permissions
- GDPR-compliant deletion (data actually deleted, not just flagged)

### Offline-First Synchronization
- All operations work offline by default
- Conflict resolution via last-write-wins + vector clocks
- Sync happens automatically when connectivity returns
- Configurable sync strategies per application

### Security by Design
- End-to-end encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- No plaintext data in transit or at rest
- Agent-centric identity (decentralized, not federated)
- Regular security audits (funded in grant)

## Strategic Context: Why Now?

### November 2024 Cable Cuts
Concrete demonstration that current infrastructure is vulnerable. CivicBase-enabled systems would have maintained local operations via mesh networks.

### MCF Totalförsvar Doctrine (2024:1032)
Myndigheten för civilt försvars renewed emphasis on:
- **Psychological resilience** (försvarsvilja) → Social capital via Hearts
- **Economic continuity** → Offline payment capability
- **Communication redundancy** → Mesh networking

### EU Digital Sovereignty Push
Growing recognition that dependency on American tech platforms is strategic vulnerability. CivicBase provides Swedish alternative.

### G20 Inequality Report (November 2025)
Recommends "valorizing unpaid care work" to strengthen social cohesion and resist destabilization. Hearts currency operationalizes this.

## 12-Month Development Plan (Vinnova Funding)

**Budget:** 2.5M SEK  
**Timeline:** January 2026 - December 2026  
**Deliverable:** Production-ready CivicBase platform with TAK-405 proof-of-concept

### Phase 1 (Months 1-4): Core Infrastructure
- libp2p P2P networking
- Offline data layer with sync
- GDPR-compliant architecture
- Distributed systems consultant (800K SEK)

### Phase 2 (Months 5-9): Application Integration
- TAK-405 Hearts currency implementation
- Mesh networking under disruption scenarios
- Academic platform (knowledge sharing)

### Phase 3 (Months 10-12): Testing & Audit
- Simulated cable cut scenarios (72+ hour offline test)
- Professional security audit (400K SEK)
- Municipal deployment guides
- Q1 2027: TAK-405 alpha launch

**Parallel track:** MCF-funded skärgård pilot (resource coordination + FRG integration)

## Join the Effort

This isn't just another open source project. This is **infrastructure for Swedish digital sovereignty and democratic resilience**.

We're looking for:

- **Distributed systems experts** who understand P2P architecture
- **Security researchers** who can audit offline reconciliation protocols
- **Municipal partners** willing to pilot crisis-ready services
- **Policy advocates** who understand totalförsvar requirements
- **Anyone** who believes Sweden deserves infrastructure that works during crises

**We're not building this to compete with cloud providers. We're building it because Swedish municipalities need infrastructure that survives when the cables are cut.**

## Appendix: SharedSpheres Connection

CivicBase grew out of CivicBase/SharedSpheres vision of user-controlled, P2P digital infrastructure. That broader vision—empowering individuals globally to own their digital lives—remains valid and is archived for future development.

**CivicBase is the Swedish, totalförsvar-focused implementation of that technical foundation.** Same P2P architecture, same offline-first design, same agent-centric data model—different framing, different initial users, different immediate purpose.

The technology enables both:
- **Global:** Digital sovereignty for individuals (SharedSpheres vision)
- **Local:** Crisis resilience for Swedish municipalities (CivicBase focus)

We're starting with CivicBase because:
1. **Funding alignment:** Vinnova + MCF grants available now
2. **Concrete need:** November 2024 exposed vulnerability
3. **Proof-of-concept:** Municipal pilots validate architecture
4. **Strategic timing:** EU sovereignty push + MCF reorganization

Once CivicBase proves the platform works at municipal scale, the SharedSpheres vision becomes feasible at global scale.
